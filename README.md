# IST 736: Text Mining

<!-- Class and Project Description
  The Text Mining class, taught by Ami M. Gates and Dr. Bei Yu, utilized Python
to analyze unstructured text data. The class focused on obtaining data, creating a corpus (physical location of store text files), cleaning and transforming data, analyzing patterns, and writing reports. The assignments that reinforced these teachings included vectorizing restaurant reviews (transforming data into a word matrix for analysis), creating various analytical models from movie reviews, learning how to crowd source labels in a dataset, and creating a cluster analysis from news data. The final project combined all these concepts through the analysis of sarcastic texts.
  Data for this project came from two locations: a Kaggle dataset containing
sarcastic Reddit comments and sarcastic/non-sarcastic tweets. The goal of this project was to determine if a sentence or paragraph could be identified as sarcastic when fit to a mixed classification model. The data was trained using naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest models. Descriptive statistics were used to understand the data before analyzing. A subset of the data was visualized to serve this purpose. The data was cleaned and vectorized using the Sklearn package for Python. The CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer functions were used to vectorize the text and create a document term matrix. This matrix contained the word frequencies for each document (Count Vectorizer for word counts and TF-IDF Vectorizer for weighted word counts). Using the matrix, the classification models were created using the sarcastic labels as the dependent variable and the word frequencies as the independent variables. Accuracy scores, heat maps, and top features were displayed to show the strength of each of the models and words. Ultimately, the model yielded fairly high accuracy for distinguishing the different types of tweets, but in a way that hadn’t been anticipated.

Learning Objectives
  The learning objective for this class was to extract text data from numerous
sources, learn how to clean and organize the data, identify patterns in text, understand the analytical tools for analysis, and relate the findings to the real world. The project reinforced the understanding of extracting both structured and unstructured text data by using sources from Twitter and Kaggle. Data had to be cleaned and organized in order to draw insights certain insights. This provided the understanding for identifying patterns in data through visualizations and statistical analysis. Using Python, this project highlighted the classification, vectorization, and visualization tools required to make sense of the data. Communication of the insights were just as important as the methodology themselves. The project reiterated the necessity for clear written and verbal communication in a structured sensible format. Text mining is very important for businesses or organizations who want to extract meaning from texts. According to Prompt Cloud (2018), the utility of text analysis might include risk management, crime prevention, customer care services, fraud detection, advertising, business intelligence, content enrichment, or spam filtering. This class and project provide a core understanding of the processes involved in these areas. -->
